# ðŸš€ Week 2 â€“ Model Building, Evaluation & Visualization  

This week focuses on implementing, evaluating, and visualizing a machine learning model using the cleaned dataset prepared in *Week 1*.  

## ðŸ“ˆ Steps Completed  

### 1. Model Selection  
- Chose *Linear Regression* for predicting continuous values (e.g., *AC power in watts*).  

### 2. Model Training & Prediction  
- Fitted the Linear Regression model on the training data.  
- Predicted values on the test set.  

### 3. Model Evaluation  
- Calculated key performance metrics:  
  - *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*  
  - *RÂ² Score* (explained variance)  
- Achieved *very high predictive performance* (RÂ² â‰ˆ *0.999*).  

### 4. Visualization  
- Plotted a *scatter graph* comparing actual vs. predicted values.  
- Overlaid the fitted *regression line* for visual assessment.  
- Used *Matplotlib* for clear graphical representation.  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, mean_squared_error, r2_score)  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
