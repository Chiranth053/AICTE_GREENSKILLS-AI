# AICTE_WEEK-1_GREENSKILLS-AI

# ðŸŒ± Week 1 â€“ Virtual Internship (Shell, via Edunet & AICTE)

This repository contains my **Week 1 work** from the Virtual Internship program with **Shell Company**.  
The focus of this week was on exploring **Machine Learning techniques** and preparing a dataset to predict **carbon emissions from cars**.
